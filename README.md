## Installation and Contribution

0. Install git and php

1. Open your terminal app and clone this repo by running the following command

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/v3ceban/coen60-term-project.git
   ```

   This will download this repository to your pc as a folder. You can rename it
   and place whenever you like. You only need to do this step once.

2. Before writing your code, make sure to update the repo by running

   ```bash
   git pull
   ```

   This will download all the updates that other people made before you. It's **very**
   important step that ensures you don't end up working on something that was
   already done.

3. After you are done making changes, run the following 3 commands:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Description of your changes"
   git push
   ```

   This will add and upload your changes to the repo.

4. To view the changes as you work on them you can run php development server

   ```bash
   php -S localhost:8080
   ```

   Make sure you run this command from the folder that contains this repo.
   If your are unsure what folder you are currently in you can run `pwd` command.
   You can navigate to the folder containing this repo by running `cd ~/path/to/folder`,
   assuming you cloned the repo somewhere in your home folder.
