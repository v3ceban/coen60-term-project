                    <li class="projectDescription">The PEAK PlasmaBlade provides precise
                        tissue dissection with the bleeding control
                        of electrosurgery. During research and
                        development, PlasmaBlade prototypes
                        are tested on tissue models in a laboratory
                        environment. To facilitate control and automation
                        of performance testing, Medtronic Advanced
                        Energy tasked the team with developing a test
                        simulator for PlasmaBlade devices.
